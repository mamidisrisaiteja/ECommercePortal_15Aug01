## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### Repository Secrets
Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Slack Integration (Optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=<your-slack-webhook-url>

# Security Scanning (Optional)
SECURITY_TOKEN=<token-for-security-scans>

# Additional API Keys (as needed)
ALLURE_TOKEN=<allure-server-token>
```

### Repository Settings
1. Enable GitHub Actions in repository settings
2. Configure GitHub Pages for Allure report hosting
3. Set up branch protection rules (optional)
4. Configure notification preferences

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Running Pipelines

#### 1. CI Pipeline
- **Automatic**: Triggers on push to main branch
- **Manual**: Go to Actions → CI Pipeline → Run workflow

#### 2. Regression Tests
- **Scheduled**: Runs daily at 2 AM UTC
- **Manual**: Actions → Regression Tests → Run workflow
  - Choose browsers: chromium, firefox, webkit, all
  - Select test tags: smoke, regression, all
  - Set parallel workers: 1-4

#### 3. MCP Integration
- **Scheduled**: Runs every 6 hours
- **Manual**: Actions → MCP Integration → Run workflow
  - Test modes: full, quick, codegen_only, validation_only

### Viewing Results
1. **GitHub Actions**: View pipeline execution logs and status
2. **Allure Reports**: Access via GitHub Pages URL
3. **Artifacts**: Download test results, screenshots, and logs
4. **Issues**: Auto-created issues for failures with detailed information
